# Moving on to Pytorch

After my exploits in C++ didn't bring much success, I decided to move on to PyTorch.
i started learning Python, and I created this model after a few days.
Though the testing loss was simmilar to the C++ one, the code got smaller, which was definietely the way forward.

I'll come back here later to write a little more about it
