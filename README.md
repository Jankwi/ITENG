# ITENG
This repository serves as a museum for the beggining of my journey with AI.

My journey with AI and ML started in  the summer of 2023, when I first watched Andrej Karpathy's video about backpropagation.
I imediatelly challenged myself to build a simple classifier model from scratch. The model's task is to distinguish English and Italian words.

This repository is a collection of my more and more advanced attempts to achieve a better score on a very imperfect dataset for this task.
(Spoiler alert: I just scraped 4 random Wikipedia pages ;-))


## [ITENG 1.0 (C++)](https://github.com/Jankwi/ITENG/tree/main/ITENG%201.0)  
![medium.com RNN image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*Ne7jPeR6Vrl1f9d7pLLG8Q.jpeg)  
This is my first ever attempt at building a Neural Network. It achieves ~65% accuracy.

## [ITENG 2.0 (Moving on to PyTorch)](https://github.com/Jankwi/ITENG/tree/main/ITENG%202.0)  
![medium.com RNN image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*Ne7jPeR6Vrl1f9d7pLLG8Q.jpeg)  
This network was one of my first attempts to write code in Python. It achieves ~65% accuracy, while being much clearer than its predecessor.

## [ITENG 3.0 (RNN)](https://github.com/Jankwi/ITENG/tree/main/ITENG%203.0)

The third and by far most advanced is written using a custom torch nn.Module class. It achieves ~90% accuracy.
