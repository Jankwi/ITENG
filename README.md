This repository serves as a museum for the beggining of my journey with AI.

My journey with AI and ML started in  the summer of 2023, when I first watched Andrej Karpathy's video about backpropagation.
I imediatelly challenged myself to build a simple classifier model from scratch, which would distinguish English and Italian words.

This repository is a collection of my more and more advanced attempts to achieve a better score on a very imperfect dataset for this task.
(Spoiler alert: I just scraped 4 random Wikipedia pages ;-))
